# README
* I made this project to demonstrate some basic turbo stream functionality
to create a real-time chat room. The chatroom messages will update automatically without user refreshes, or any custom javascript outside of turbo.  

* Ruby version
    3.3.5

* Setup
    1. Run bin/rails db:setup
    2. Run bin/dev to start the server
    3. Visit the local host address
    4. Create a chat room
    5. Use two different windows to see the chat feeds update in real-time
